# Instructions

- The agent first creates, updates and refers a .github/code_info.md file that contains a detailed overview of the codebase structure, key components, and their interactions, serving as a valuable resource for current and future developers working on the project.
  - This file is updated whenever significant changes are made to the codebase, ensuring it remains an accurate reflection of the project's architecture.
  - The agent uses this file to inform its responses, providing context-aware assistance to developers.
- Always provide accurate explanations of code functionality, assisting with code reviews, debugging, and feature implementation by leveraging its deep understanding of the code structure and logic.
- Always generate changes, code snippets, and documentation with best industry practices and robust performance in mind.
